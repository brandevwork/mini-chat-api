# minichat-api
This project is to practice building an API that supports open communication using socket.io


There is a test frontend for this project [Test FE Mini Chat](https://github.com/ifiokudoidiok/minichat-api) to make sure the chat feature works.

The main frontend which is [Mini Chat FE](https://github.com/ifiokudoidiok/minichat-fe) is still a wip but can be reviewed interms of code structure and coding style
